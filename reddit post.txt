To my mind there are two reasons why people who believe the EOS tech is legit would nonetheless want to start a different chain with a competing distribution, like XNN for example which would have a distribution based on ETH balance.  1) You are not an ETH whale  (i.e. you are small even compared to the EOS market cap -- say < $1,000,000 in assets) and you believe in the EOS tech, but you think the ICO is flawed. Perhaps you think EOS and the ICO investors deserve to get fleeced, or you just want to invest in the tech with a clean slate. But if you still believe the return on the alt EOS coin will higher than the return on ETH, despite the efforts, the question becomes: would you gain more by waiting for your ETH to vest as a small percentage of the "alt" EOS chain, or invest now into a much smaller pool? Given the market cap of ETH is about 30X that of EOS, you can assume about a 30X multiplier on whatever the excess return is (EOS-ETH). Basically, investing in the main ICO means being able to leverage up to 30x, rather than accepting a distro that is handed to you. So being bullish on the EOS tech vs ethereum but not investing in the ICO doesn't make sense 2) You are an ETH whale and you see EOS as a threat, and want to crush the ICO. In this case it seems clear that once the ICO is over, the developers and token holders on this chain won't have an interest in developing the best dApps, and as a result, it probably will not be attractive to investors and developers. So again, the reason
